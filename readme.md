# FOS - Custom OS with Dynamic Memory Allocation, CPU Utilization, Parallel Processing, and Shared Resource Management

## Introduction

This project is a university project for the Operating Systems (OS) subject. The objective of the project is to implement various functions in a custom-made OS that addresses issues related to dynamic memory allocation, CPU utilization, parallel processing, and shared resource management.

## Features Implemented

- Dynamic memory allocation: A custom memory management system that allocates and deallocates memory dynamically, based on the needs of the running programs.
- CPU utilization: A scheduler that dynamically adjusts the allocation of CPU resources to ensure that all programs are executed efficiently.
- Parallel processing: The ability to run multiple programs simultaneously, utilizing multiple cores or processors.
- Shared resource management: A mechanism for managing access to shared resources, such as files and printers, by multiple programs.
